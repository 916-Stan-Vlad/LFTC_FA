Finite Automaton Program
The Finite Automaton (FA) program is a C++ implementation that reads the elements of a Finite Automaton (FA) from a file, displays its components, and verifies if a sequence is accepted by the FA.

Program Components:
FiniteAutomaton Class:

Represents the FA with states, alphabet, transitions, initial state, and final states.
Provides functions to read FA elements from a file, display FA elements, and check if a sequence is accepted.
Main Program:

Reads the FA from the file "FA.in".
Displays the set of states, alphabet, transitions, initial state, and final states.
Prompts the user to enter a sequence and checks if it is accepted by the DFA.
How to Use:
Create an input file "FA.in" following the format described below.
Compile and run the C++ program.


FA.in:

3   // Number of states
0 1 2   // Set of states

2   // Number of alphabet symbols
0 1   // Alphabet

5   // Number of transitions
0 0 0   // Transition: q0 -> q0 on 0
0 1 1   // Transition: q0 -> q1 on 1
1 0 1   // Transition: q1 -> q0 on 0
1 1 2   // Transition: q1 -> q2 on 1
2 0 2   // Transition: q2 -> q2 on 0

0   // Initial state

1   // Number of final states
2   // Final state
